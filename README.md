## 📝 Introduction

The name Protypo originates from the Greek word πρότυπο (pronounced pro-tý-po), meaning 'model', 'template', or 'pattern'. Protypo is a powerful code generator that transforms entity definitions into fully functional code, allowing you to quickly scaffold entire backend systems, APIs, and more.


Built for speed and flexibility, Protypo brings modern code generation to Rust, combining the performance of a Rust-based tool with the convenience of customizable templates for various programming languages and architectures.

## Features
- 🚀 Supports `MiniJinja` (default) and `Tera` template engines.
- 🛠️ Generates code based on JSON schemas for APIs, microservices, and more.
- 📦 Customizable generators for different frameworks and programming languages.
- 📂 Project structure designed for flexibility and scalability.
- 🔧 Extensible configuration files for defining templates, dependencies, and resources.
